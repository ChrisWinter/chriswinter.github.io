Hello, and welcome to my website!

Here you will find write-ups on my various experiments in programming, science,
mathematics, and finance. I may occasionally post book reviews, and other
thoughts that are connected with those subjects.

## Contact

If you have any comments, questions, or just want to get in touch, feel free to
send me an email: <wintercni@gmail.com>.

I am on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wintercni/), if you want to
connect with me there.

And here's my [GitHub](https://github.com/ChrisWinter) page, where I publish my
monstrosities.
