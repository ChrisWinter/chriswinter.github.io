To get things started off on the right foot here, I've re-published on GitHub a
library of fundamental data structures and algorithms that I wrote in C about
10 years ago as a showpiece when interviewing for my current job. The library
is called **[libcore][1]** since it's a library of core data structures and
algorithms.

Working on [libcore][1] was a great experience. If you want to better
understand the typical data structures and algorithms provided by modern
programming langagues, implementing them yourself is an excellent way
to do that. It's also an opportunity to learn a new programming language
while you're at it.

I made extensive use of [Introduction to Algorithms][2] and [The Algorithm
Design Manual][3] when writing [libcore][1]. They are classics in the field of
computer science, and definitely worth having in your collection. The 3rd
edition of [The Algorithm Design Manual][3] is coming out in June, 2022.  Get
that one if you can because the 2nd edition has quite a few errors in it.
